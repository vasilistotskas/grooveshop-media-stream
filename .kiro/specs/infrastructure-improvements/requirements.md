# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines infrastructure improvements for the Grooveshop Media Stream microservice to enhance performance, reliability, observability, and maintainability. The improvements focus on adding modern infrastructure patterns while maintaining the existing clean architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Layer Caching System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a multi-layer caching system so that frequently accessed images are served faster and reduce disk I/O operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is requested THEN the system SHALL check memory cache first before file cache
2. WHEN memory cache misses THEN the system SHALL check Redis cache before processing
3. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL store it in both memory and Redis cache
4. WHEN cache reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL use LRU eviction strategy
5. IF Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to file-based caching

### Requirement 2: Configuration Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management so that environment variables are validated and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
3. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL use a centralized ConfigService
4. WHEN environment changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading of non-critical settings
5. IF required config is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of expected values

### Requirement 3: Health Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive health monitoring so that I can track system performance and detect issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return detailed health status
2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL emit performance metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL track error rates and types
4. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL provide correlation IDs for tracing
5. IF external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL report dependency health status

### Requirement 4: HTTP Connection Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized HTTP connections so that external image fetching is more efficient and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching external images THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling
2. WHEN requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry
3. WHEN connections timeout THEN the system SHALL have configurable timeout values
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL reuse existing connections
5. IF connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately

### Requirement 5: Request Processing Enhancement

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want reliable request processing so that image requests are handled efficiently even under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement throttling
2. WHEN processing large images THEN the system SHALL use background job queues
3. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL assign unique correlation IDs
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed validation errors
5. IF system is overloaded THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade service

### Requirement 6: Storage Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent storage management so that disk space is used efficiently and cache performance is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache storage reaches threshold THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent eviction
2. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL update access timestamps
3. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL preserve frequently accessed files
4. WHEN storage is low THEN the system SHALL emit warnings and cleanup aggressively
5. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operation

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Validation and Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive input validation so that the system is protected against malicious requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image parameters are received THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters
2. WHEN file sizes exceed limits THEN the system SHALL reject requests with appropriate errors
3. WHEN URLs are provided THEN the system SHALL validate URL format and allowed domains
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user inputs
5. IF malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL track processing times
2. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL monitor hit/miss ratios
3. WHEN memory usage changes THEN the system SHALL track memory consumption
4. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL measure response times
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL emit alerts and metrics
